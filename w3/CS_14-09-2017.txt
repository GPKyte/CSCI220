Scenario: Old machine is slow, will a better computer provide a significant
  enough increase in speed based on our algorithm?

Suppose, for your algorithm, f(n) = 2n^2 In T seconds, you can process n inputs.
If you get a computer 64 times faster, how many inputs can you process in T seconds?
Original Job: n inputs = 2n^2steps
Current Machine: 2n^2/T steps/second
New Machine: 64 x 2n^2 /T  steps/second
New Job: m inputs = 2m^2steps
What input, size m, can we process now in T seconds?
(2m^2 steps) / (128n^2 /T steps/second) = T seconds
2m^2  = 128n^2
m^2 = 64n^2
m = 8n
You can process 8 times more input each second

f(n) = 2n^3 + 5
64 * f(n) = 128n^3 + 320
2m^3 + 5 steps = 128n^3 + 320 steps
m^3 steps = 64n^3 + 157 steps
m = (64n^3 + 157)^1/3
m is can process some times more input each second
